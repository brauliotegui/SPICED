- Our model contains a Markov Chain: defined states S0...S2 and transition probs P
- randomly sample steps:
1. create an agent in initial state (plane, customer or random choice, x/y)
2. randomly perform a move (choose the next state with P|S, go left/right/up/down/fire)
3. store the current state somewhere
4. have a stop condition
- repeat the above step N times
- store the results (CSV? JSON?)
