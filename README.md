## Week 01| Gapminder: Data Visualization Project

* The project analyzes the Gapminder project's data and helps to visualize the
correlation between each country's population and fertiliy rate. The gif image was generated with python and matplotlib. 
* Life Expectancy vs. Fertility:

* The Jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/brauliotegui/SPICED/blob/master/Week_02/Titanic_ModelProject.ipynb).

## Week 02| Titanic: Classifier/ Logistic Regression Project

* This project approaches a classic Machine Learning problem, with a classication model, in order to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
With python and sklearn library, after a detailed process of feature engineering, I was able to train a Random Forest and Logistic Regression model
with accuracy scores inbetween 81% and 84%. A k-fold Cross Validation was used to test the machine learning models and presented consistent scores
around 94%.

The Jupyter notebook for this small project can be found [here](https://github.com/brauliotegui/SPICED/blob/master/Week_01/2.7_animate.ipynb).
