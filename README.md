## Week 01| Gapminder: Data Visualization Project

* The project analyzes the Gapminder project's data and helps to visualize the
correlation between each country's population and fertiliy rate. The gif image was generated with python and matplotlib. 
* Life Expectancy vs. Fertility:

## Week 02| Titanic: Classifier/ Logistic Regression Project

* This project approaches a classic Machine Learning problem, with a classication model, in order to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
With python and sklearn library, after a detailed process of feature engineering, I was able to train a Random Forest and Logistic Regression model
with accuracy scores inbetween 81% and 84%. A k-fold Cross Validation was used to test the machine learning models and presented consistent scores
around 94%.

* The Jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/brauliotegui/SPICED/blob/master/Week_02/Titanic_ModelProject.ipynb).

## Week 03| Bikeshare: Linear Regression 

* Here the approach to Machine Learning is done with Linear Regression models. Through intensive Data Exploration Analysis, correlation analysis, and
feature engineering with dates, I was able to construct robust models to estimate number of bike rentals on a particular time. GridSearchCV was used
to attain the best fitting model which indicated Linear models with above average mean test scores.

* The Jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/brauliotegui/SPICED/blob/master/Week_03/Project_CapitalBikeShare_Regression.ipynb).

## Week 04| Bikeshare: Lyrics Classifier - Natural Language Processing Project

* The goal here is to build a text classification model to predict the artist from a piece of text. I programmed python functions to perform Web Scraping done with BeautifulSoup to download song lyrics from specifc artists url and save only the corpus lyrics as texts files from every single song lyrics url. Class imbalance was dealt with over sampling, texts were engineered with CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer, and Machine Learning was done by training classification models... (to be updated)

## Week 05| Forecast Model

* For this project, I created a short-term temperature forecast. This involved Time series to predict future temperature for a specific location using AR and ARIMA models with a Walk Forward approach, achieving a MAE as low as 1.8.

* The Jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/brauliotegui/SPICED/blob/master/Week_05/Project_TimeSeriesAnalysis-Final.ipynb).

## Week 06| Project Dashboard: Postgres, SQL queries, RDS, and AWS

* For this project, ...
